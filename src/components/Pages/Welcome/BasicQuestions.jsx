                                A stock, also known as equity, is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of the issuing corporation. Units of stock are called shares, which entitle the owner to a proportion of the corporationâ€™s assets and profits equal to how much stock they own.

                                    Trading involves the buying and selling of financial instruments like stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and derivatives to make a profit. It can be conducted on various markets, including stock exchanges and over-the-counter markets. Unlike long-term investing, trading focuses on capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations, requiring a thorough understanding of market dynamics, technical analysis, and risk management.

                                    Trading, in simple terms, is the act of buying and selling financial instruments (like shares, forex, and indices) without directly owning them, in the hopes of making a profit from changes in their price movements.

                                    Stock Trading and Investing are two different ways in which one can make a profit in the financial markets. An investor is one who holds the position or the security for a longer period and is a long-term player, while the trader is one who is affected by the movement of the securities in the market.
                                </li>

                                    Investing and trading both involve buying financial assets, such as stocks, ETFs, and bonds, with the goal of growing your money.

                                    The difference is in the timeline. Stock trading is about buying and selling shares for short-term profit, such as within a week or a day. Investing refers to buying and selling stocks for long-term gains, such as within months or years.
